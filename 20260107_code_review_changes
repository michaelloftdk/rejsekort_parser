Major refactoring: Add robust parsing, validation, and verbose mode

This commit represents a comprehensive refactoring of the Rejsekort PDF
parser to improve reliability, maintainability, and user experience.

Motivation:
- Initial version (v27) had fragile parsing logic
- Failed to handle edge cases (multiple formats, encoding issues)
- Lacked validation and error reporting
- No debug capability for troubleshooting

Core Functionality Improvements:
- Add support for multiple travelers per journey with flexible parsing
- Fix multi-journey PDF handling using price-first parsing approach
- Implement non-breaking space (0xa0) removal from PDF text
- Change CSV format to European standard (semicolon delimiter, comma decimal)
- Add UTF-8 BOM for better Excel compatibility

Robustness & Validation:
- Add location validation (length, special character detection)
- Implement robust date extraction with English/Danish month support
- Add filename-based date fallback
- Add date range validation (2020 to current year + 1)
- Implement case-insensitive traveler type matching
- Add distance validation between journey and price entries

Performance & Code Quality:
- Pre-compile all regex patterns at module level
- Add "Journeys" section detection to limit search scope
- Refactor into focused, testable functions (SRP)
- Add comprehensive docstrings and inline documentation

User Experience:
- Add argparse-based CLI with --verbose/-v flag
- Implement conditional debug output (DEBUG/WARNING/ERROR levels)
- Improve error messages with actionable information
- Add --help with usage examples
- Show full tracebacks only in verbose mode

Code Organization:
- Extract date logic into extract_date_robust()
- Extract validation into validate_location()
- Extract traveler parsing into parse_travellers_flexible()
- Create global TRAVELLER_TYPES dictionary for normalization
- Add VERBOSE flag for output control

Testing:
- Validated against 4 sample PDFs (7 journeys total)
- Tested single/multiple journey scenarios
- Tested multiple travelers per journey
- Verified date extraction across formats

Breaking Changes:
- CSV now uses semicolon delimiter and comma decimal separator
- Requires argparse (Python 3.2+, part of stdlib)
